	<h2><i>Foggy climate, trekking under rain showers, an adventurous route, interacting with tribals, and seeing the beautiful city of Vizag from 3,400 feet above sea level. Are you wondering where this place is? It is Vanjangi Hills, known as the place to see some of the most beautiful sunrises. Located near Paderu, in the Eastern Ghats of Andhra Pradesh of the Visakhapatnam Agency, Vanjangi is a must-visit place for all the mountain trekkers. Many of us use the phrase “on cloud nine” to describe our happiest moments. A trek to Vanjangi actually makes you feel as if you are standing on the clouds. Once you reach the spot, do not forget to shout out loud whatever you feel at the moment. Yo! Vizag shares some of the things to know before you visit the Vanjangi hills, especially this monsoon season.
